# Eco mod for craftable, placeable Stone
This mod adds an Item for each Stone type that allows placing the naturaly occuring variant of that stone. Additionally they can be crafted in a MasonryTable if you're Mining level 5.

## Disclaimer
These Items do not have an Icon. Starting the server/world without the mod will cause all Natural Stone in Stockpiles and Inventories to disappear, but placed Natural Stone will stay.

## Installation from source
Run the `generate.sh` script, then copy the builds/NaturalStone folder to `Eco_Data\Server\Mods\UserCode` and restart the server.

## Installation using a release
Download the release, unzip it and put the NaturalStone folder in `Eco_Data\Server\Mods\UserCode`.
